# SDI Director of Information Security – Mock Paper Test (Sample Answers, 1-Page)

## Prompt 1: 30/60/90 Day Plan
**0–30 Days**: Build OT/IT asset and criticality map (mills, rolling/coating, recycling, fabrication); validate current NIST-aligned controls, IR/BC/DR; meet plant leaders to align change windows; deliver a top-5 production-impacting risk list with estimated downtime exposure.[1]  
**31–60 Days**: Implement quick wins at highest-risk sites (segmentation, privileged access hardening, secure vendor remote access); launch critical vendor triage; stand up a monthly risk dashboard for CFO/Audit with business-impact metrics.  
**61–90 Days**: Run an OT tabletop focused on line disruption/recovery; update playbooks; publish a 12‑month roadmap with budget, ROI, and measurable KPIs (asset coverage, MFA, IR readiness); formalize risk acceptance and escalation.

## Prompt 2: Incident Scenario (Malware on Flat Roll Segment)
**Contain**: Activate IR; isolate affected segment; keep safety and core controls stable; preserve logs and system state.  
**Recover**: Identify root cause, restore from known-good baselines, validate safety interlocks, monitor for recurrence.  
**Communicate**: Hourly plant updates; exec summary to COO/CFO; escalate to Audit if material.  
**Improve**: Close gaps (segmentation, access, detection), update playbooks, run follow-up drills.

## Prompt 3: Board/Audit Committee Reporting
- Top 3–5 risks tied to production downtime, safety, and revenue impact.  
- Trend KPIs: OT asset visibility, segmentation coverage, MFA/privileged access coverage, third‑party risk ratings, IR readiness (tabletop frequency, RTO/MTTR).  
- Exceptions/risk acceptances with rationale and expiry; funding priorities with ROI framing.

## Prompt 4: Third-Party Risk
- Tier vendors by production impact; enforce secure remote access (MFA, JIT, session logging).  
- Contract SLAs for incident notification and patch timelines; targeted assessments for Tier 1 vendors.  
- Validate controls without disrupting production.

## Prompt 5: OT/IT Convergence Strategy
- Shared governance with Operations and a co-owned risk register.  
- Phased segmentation and monitoring aligned to outages.  
- OT-specific IR playbooks and recurring plant team training.
