# SDI Director of Information Security – Interview Cheat Sheet (One Page)

## 30-Second Opening
I build security programs that protect uptime, safety, and financial performance in OT-heavy environments. At SDI, that means measurable reduction in production disruption risk, clear Board/Audit reporting, and pragmatic controls that operators can live with. My first 90 days would map critical OT/IT pathways, close the top exposure gaps, and establish a cadence of risk metrics tied to operational and financial outcomes.

## CEO Focus (Strategy, Risk, Shareholder Value)
Key messages:
- Security is an enabler for reliable production and predictable cash flow through the cycle.
- Tie cyber risk to operational downtime costs and customer delivery risk.
- Align security investment with enterprise risk management and capital allocation.

Sample CEO questions:
- Where do you see the biggest threats to uptime and margin expansion over the next 12–24 months?
- How does SDI want cyber risk quantified alongside safety and operational risk?

Sample CEO answer:
“I’d quantify cyber risk in terms of production downtime exposure, safety impact, and potential revenue disruption. My goal is to reduce those quantified risks with targeted OT segmentation, privileged access control, and incident response readiness—while keeping operations moving.”

## COO Focus (Operations, OT/IT Convergence)
Key messages:
- Prioritize OT visibility, segmentation, and recovery playbooks.
- Schedule security changes around maintenance windows and production reality.
- Focus on high-availability controls that minimize plant disruption.

Sample COO questions:
- Which mills or lines are most sensitive to unplanned downtime today?
- What’s the current process for OT patching and emergency response?

Sample COO answer:
“I would start with an OT asset and network visibility baseline, then focus on segmentation and secure remote access. I’ll align patching and testing to planned outages and build a rapid recovery playbook for line-critical systems.”

## CFO Focus (Governance, Compliance, Cost Control)
Key messages:
- Cyber governance is Board/Audit visible; use clear metrics and thresholds.
- Emphasize risk reduction, insurance posture, and regulatory readiness.
- Tie spend to outcomes (risk reduction, avoided downtime, audit readiness).

Sample CFO questions:
- How are cyber risk metrics currently reported to Audit?
- What are the top cost drivers in the security program?

Sample CFO answer:
“I’ll deliver a quarterly risk dashboard aligned to NIST controls, with trends on high-severity exposures, third-party risk, and incident readiness. We’ll focus on cost-effective controls that reduce downtime and regulatory exposure.”

## SDI-Specific Facts to Reference
- CFO oversees IT and cybersecurity; Director of Information Security leads the InfoSec team and program.[1]
- Cyber program aligns to NIST; includes continuous monitoring, mandatory monthly training, phishing tests, third‑party risk assessments, and IR exercises.[1]
- Board/Audit Committee receive regular cyber briefings; third‑party program assessments and pen tests occur on a biennial basis.[1]
- SDI reports no material cybersecurity incidents in the last three years, but flags cyber threats to manufacturing systems as material risk.[1]
- 2024 net sales $17.54B; operating income $1.94B; net income $1.54B.[1]

## Likely Paper Test Prompts (and How to Answer)
- 30/60/90 plan: Start with OT visibility + criticality mapping; quickly close top access/segmentation gaps; formalize IR and reporting cadence.
- Incident scenario: Focus on containment, production continuity, and recovery; emphasize communication to ops leadership and Audit Committee.
- Program maturity: Present NIST-aligned gap analysis and KPI roadmap (asset coverage, MFA coverage, privileged access, IR drill frequency).

## Your Closing Line
“My objective is to protect SDI’s production engine. If we reduce cyber risk to OT systems and ensure rapid recovery, we protect safety, margins, and customer trust at scale.”
