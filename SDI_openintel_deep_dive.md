# Steel Dynamics (SDI) Open-Intel Deep Dive

## Purpose
Prepare for the Director of Information Security paper test and CEO/COO/CFO interviews with a concise, evidence-based briefing focused on leadership, financials, operations/footprint, culture, and litigation/regulatory exposure.

## Executive Summary
- SDI is a vertically connected steel company with major segments in steel operations, metals recycling, and steel fabrication; steel operations represented 69% of 2024 net sales and the company runs EAF-based mills with significant flat roll and long products capacity.[1]

- Expect location, industry, and total compensation mix (bonus, equity, retirement) to shift this range; Fort Wayne, IN benchmarks may be lower than coastal metro averages.[2]

## Interview and Paper Test Preparation

### Themes to Emphasize
- Operational resilience: tie security controls to plant uptime, safety, and cost of downtime for EAF/rolling operations.
- OT/IT convergence: segmentation, secure remote access, and monitoring for industrial control systems.
- Risk governance: Board/Audit reporting cadence, metrics, and integration with enterprise risk management.
- Third-party exposure: supplier and vendor risk assessments tied to SDI's recycling and manufacturing ecosystem.

### CEO Interview (Strategy and Risk)
- Ask how SDI balances growth investments (new mills, aluminum, recycling) with risk appetite and cyber resilience.
- Align security goals with uptime, safety, and shareholder value; emphasize risk quantification and investment ROI.
- Discuss how cyber risk is integrated into enterprise strategy and M&A diligence.

### COO Interview (Operations and OT)
- Ask about top operational bottlenecks and where cyber/OT risk most threatens production.
- Discuss plant network segmentation, patching windows, and incident response for OT environments.
- Emphasize measurable reductions in downtime risk and recovery time objectives.

### CFO Interview (Governance and Compliance)
- Ask about how cybersecurity metrics are reported to the Audit Committee and how budget decisions are made.
- Discuss insurance, SEC disclosure expectations, and cost tradeoffs of security investments.
- Align on risk reduction in financial terms (loss avoidance, insurance premiums, regulatory exposure).

### Likely Paper Test Areas
- 30-60-90 day assessment plan focused on OT/IT risk, third-party risk, and identity/privileged access.
- Incident response design for manufacturing disruption scenarios.
- Security program maturity assessment aligned to NIST and measurable KPIs.
- Vendor and supply chain security controls for scrap procurement, logistics, and plant systems.

## Open Questions and Gaps to Validate
- Reporting line and scope for the Director of Information Security relative to the CFO and ISG governance council.[1]
- Current OT security tooling coverage across mills and fabrication plants.
- Third-party risk assessment cadence and enforcement for critical suppliers and logistics partners.
- Cyber insurance coverage limits, exclusions, and incident response retainer arrangements.
