# SDI InfoSec Prioritization BINGO Framework

## BINGO Acronym
- **B** - Business Impact: Revenue, uptime, safety, and customer delivery risk.
- **I** - Incident Risk: Likelihood of a disruptive event (OT/IT, ransomware, vendor).
- **N** - Near-Term Urgency: Deadlines, active vulnerabilities, and time-bound commitments.
- **G** - Governance/Compliance: Audit findings, regulatory deadlines, and board visibility.
- **O** - Operational Readiness: Ability to execute now (resources, change windows, dependencies).

## How To Use
- Score each item 1-5 for each letter (total 5-25).
- Fast-track if total >= 20 or any 5 in B/I/G.
- Defer if total < 12 unless mandated by leadership or regulation.
- Use tie-breakers: WSJF (Cost of Delay / Job Size) or Impact vs. Effort.

## Scoring Table

| Letter | 1 (Low) | 3 (Medium) | 5 (High) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| B |  |  |  |
| I |  |  |  |
| N |  |  |  |
| G |  |  |  |
| O |  |  |  |

## Example (Short)
Project: OT remote access hardening at a flat roll mill
- B: 5 (uptime and safety exposure)
- I: 4 (remote access is a common incident vector)
- N: 3 (change window within 60 days)
- G: 4 (audit or board visibility)
- O: 4 (controls and resources available)
Total: 20 -> Fast-track
