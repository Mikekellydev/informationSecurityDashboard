# SDI Director of Information Security – Mock Paper Test

## Instructions
Timebox: 60–90 minutes. Answer in 1–2 pages total. Use clear headings and bullet points. Emphasize OT/IT production continuity, NIST alignment, governance, and measurable outcomes.

## Prompt 1: 30/60/90 Day Plan
You are starting as Director of Information Security at SDI. Provide a 30/60/90 day plan focused on OT/IT risk, governance, and quick wins without disrupting production.

Answer outline:
- 0–30 days
  - Establish OT/IT asset visibility and criticality map (mills, rolling, coating, fabrication).
  - Review incident response, BC/DR, and existing NIST-aligned controls.
  - Identify top 5 risks that could stop production; align with ops leaders.
- 31–60 days
  - Implement priority controls: segmentation, privileged access, secure remote access.
  - Launch third-party risk triage for critical suppliers and OT vendors.
  - Define KPI dashboard for Audit Committee (high severity findings, MFA coverage, IR readiness).
- 61–90 days
  - Run OT tabletop exercise and validate recovery playbooks.
  - Formalize risk acceptance process and escalation thresholds.
  - Build 12-month roadmap with budget and ROI framing (downtime risk reduction).

## Prompt 2: Incident Scenario
A malware incident impacts a plant network segment that supports a flat roll line. The plant is operating but latency is rising and operators see intermittent HMI issues.

Answer outline:
- Containment
  - Activate IR playbook; isolate affected segment; preserve safety and core operations.
  - Coordinate with plant leadership on safe-mode operations and production priorities.
- Eradication/Recovery
  - Identify root cause (remote access, vendor, phishing, OT asset).
  - Restore from known-good baselines; verify OT safety interlocks.
- Communication
  - Hourly ops updates; executive summary to COO/CFO; Audit Committee notify if material.
  - Document timeline and decisions for regulatory/insurance needs.
- Post-incident
  - Close control gaps (segmentation, identity, monitoring).
  - Update training and vendor controls based on findings.

## Prompt 3: Board/Audit Committee Reporting
Design a quarterly cyber risk report for the Board and Audit Committee.

Answer outline:
- Top risks (3–5) tied to business impact (downtime, safety, revenue).
- Trend metrics (coverage and movement):
  - OT asset visibility % and network segmentation coverage.
  - MFA/privileged access coverage.
  - Third-party risk rating for top vendors.
  - IR readiness: tabletop frequency, MTTR estimates.
- Exceptions and risk acceptance decisions.
- Funding priorities and ROI framing.

## Prompt 4: Third-Party Risk
SDI relies on vendors for OT systems and maintenance. Propose a vendor risk approach that keeps operations running.

Answer outline:
- Tier vendors by criticality (production-impacting vs. non-critical).
- Require secure remote access controls and least privilege.
- Contractual requirements: incident notification, logging, patch SLAs.
- Validate through assessments and periodic audits without halting production.

## Prompt 5: OT/IT Convergence Strategy
Outline your approach to integrating OT security into enterprise security without disrupting plant operations.

Answer outline:
- Shared governance with ops; co-owned risk register.
- Phased segmentation and monitoring with change windows.
- OT-specific incident response and recovery playbooks.
- Training and awareness for plant teams; focus on practical workflows.

## Bonus: KPI Targets (Example)
- OT asset visibility: 90%+ in 90 days.
- MFA coverage for privileged accounts: 95% in 120 days.
- Third-party critical vendor reviews: 100% in 120 days.
- OT tabletop exercises: 2 per year with action plans.
